# LeetCode Arrays

This repository contains solutions to array-related problems from LeetCode, implemented in Java. Each folder corresponds to a specific problem and contains a small IntelliJ IDEA project structure with the source code under `src/`.

> This is a personal practice repository used to track progress and improve problem-solving skills for product-based company interviews.

Each `Main.java` typically contains:

- A brief comment about the problem or a link to the LeetCode statement.
- The solution method.
- A simple `main` method with sample tests.

## How to run

1. Open the repository in **IntelliJ IDEA** (or any Java IDE).
2. Open the folder of the problem you want to run (for example, `Leetcode - 121`).
3. Run `Main.java` from the IDE, or use the command line:


JDK 8 or later is recommended.

## Problems covered

- Leetcode 26 – Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- Leetcode 80 – Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
- Leetcode 88 – Merge Sorted Array
- Leetcode 121 – Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- Leetcode 189 – Rotate Array
- Leetcode 274 – H-Index

More array problems will be added over time.

## Goals

- Strengthen understanding of core array techniques (two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums, etc.).
- Write clean, readable Java solutions suitable for technical interviews.
- Use Git and GitHub to build a consistent coding portfolio.
